-Push notification from server to client
	-detail scenario for requirement

	Asmx
		-Advantage
			-As it is web service, the consumer can be in any platform. (eg. Window, OS X, Linux)
			
		-Disadvantage	
			-Only SOAP can be supported (Very difficult to implement to support RESTful)
			-Duplex communication are not supported, 
				it means whenever client need the value from server, client must send the request.
				it also means that server cannot behave as a broadcasting station.
				it also means that server do not support callback functionalities.
		
	WCF
		-Binding
			-webHttpBinding
				-support Rest 
			-basicHttpBinding
				-soap v1 (same as Asmx)
			-wsHttpBinding
				-soap v2 (more secure)
			-wsDualHttpBinding
				-Support callback
				-Support soap only but not restfull
				
	WebSocket		
		-It support full duplex communication between server and client
		 It means it can broadcast to every clients.
		-So, how to use the websocket, there is a API called SignalR developed by Microsoft. 
			
	SignalR
		-SignalR created on top of WebSocket technology.
		 It means that whatever websocket can do, SignalR can also do.
		-Allow full duplex communication between client and server
		-Put the state on top of the stateless http protocol 
		 to allow realtime communication
		-no more binding requred which we needed in WCF
		-It can integrated with RESTful service
		
		SignalR Broadcasting Design
			-Client(Phone/tablet/Computer) connect to SignalR Server
			-When the value change / when some event fired, then server broadcast a message to client.
			-Then client handle the message
