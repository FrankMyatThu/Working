Real-time web application

Several years ago, whatever we need in web application, we have to a send specific request to the web server to receive/see what we wanted.
These web application are just read only. Then user wanted to share their ideas, comments, suggestions together with the same post they are seeing at the same time. 
(Eg. check Facebook posts giving comments). And Web application started to allow user inputs. This is where problem come in. 
Let assume that so many comments have been added to the same post which you currently seeing. It may be 1 or 2 seconds later, after your page is loaded in your browser.
It means your loaded page is outdated even after 1 or 2 seconds later. If you want to see the updated comments you definitely needs to reload your page or do some action to reload. 
But most users don't want to do, they don't want to reload, but they want to see recent updates. That is where we need Real-Time web application. 

There are few ways to implement real-time web application.
-Long Pooling method (I don't like since it can overhead web server.)
-WCF duplex service (Not bad, but it only support SOAP.)
-Microsoft SignalR build on top of HTML 5 webSocket (I recommend this way. It is the most easy and most flexible way)
